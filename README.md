The happiness-score-prediction-models.ipynb contains the basic EDA of the dataset with the trials of algorithms to predict the happiness scores of countries. The three algorithms tested here were Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Support Vector Regression. Multiple Linear Regression gave an excellent result with an accuracy of 100%, followed by the Support Vector Regression(SVR) and Decision Tree Regression.

The world-happiness-report-analysis.ipynb contains all the analysis and visualizations on the dataset, ranging from correlation between the features of the dataset, to visualizations on top and bottom 10 countries on the report, to some insights on data from India in the reports.

The happiness-score-prediction.ipynb contains some more visualizations on data from the countries based on the continents they belong to, their performance on the happiness report, etc.
